# NCore

NCore is a Ruby gem designed to help build REST API clients. It is not an API
client by itself, but provides several useful building blocks to build one.

It relies on `rest-client` for HTTP handling, `multi_json` for JSON parsing
(and supports only JSON), and `activesupport`.

See `example/` for the beginning of an actual api client.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ncore'
